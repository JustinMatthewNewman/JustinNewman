              With the advent of quantum computing on the horizon, organizations
              must start preparing for the cryptographic upheaval it will bring.
              Quantum computers will render many standard public-key cryptosystems
              like RSA and elliptic curves insecure. To future-proof encryption,
              companies should begin migrating to quantum-safe algorithms
              resistant to attack by both classical and quantum algorithms.
            </p>
            <p style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
              The most promising post-quantum public-key candidates are
              lattice-based and multivariate cryptosystems. In particular, lattice
              schemes like NTRU have efficiently implementable key exchange and
              digital signatures ideal for TLS and authentication. Code-based
              cryptography like McEliece offers an alternative approach using
              error-correcting codes. On the symmetric side, algorithms with
              security proofs against quantum queries like AES-256 will likely
              remain viable. To ease the transition, hybrid schemes are emerging
              which run post-quantum crypto alongside traditional public-key. By
              incrementally adding support for algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber and
              SIKE, organizations can guard their systems against quantum threats.
              With prudent preparation, we can work to ensure sensitive data
              remains secure even in a world of quantum advantage.
