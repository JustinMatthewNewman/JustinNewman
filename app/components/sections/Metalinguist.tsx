              During my time with Metalinguist LLC, I have played a pivotal role
              in developing the many components. My contributions encompassed
              the implementation of dynamic data visualizations on both
              administrative and client dashboards, as well as the creation of
              automated Playwright tests to test order creation, login
              processes, and account entitlements. Furthermore, I significantly
              improved the onboarding process by introducing efficient DynamoDB
              queries for subdomains, effectively preventing duplicate entries
              in the best way possible. As a member of the development team, I
              continuously enriched the project by employing best practices,
              including well-organized functional components, higher-order
              functions, and React.js hooks.
